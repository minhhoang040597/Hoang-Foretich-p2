Following up on lab5 and lab7, this project was a continuation
of some of the lessons we learned in ncurses. Using that knowledge,
along with our knowledge of object oriented programming, we were able
to create a text editor similar to vi or emacs. The text editor contained
an editable text area surrounded by a menu, the title, and the name
of the file currently open in editor. It also contains a menu when the
user presses the F1 key. Similar to any word editor, this menu contains
open, save, save as, and exit. To accomplish this we utitlized concepts 
such as buffers, windows, and pads, just to name a few. It is also
worth mentioning that our program has padded line numbers and multiple
colors. This project was challenging, and as a result sometimes frustrating, but
we learned a lot and were thrilled to be able to apply our ncurses knowledge.
